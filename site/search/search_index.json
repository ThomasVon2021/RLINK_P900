Using two RLINK modules to form a pair of data links for mutual communication, when one connected to the device end and the other connected to the computer end. With three or more RLINK modules, it can be used for Point to Multipoint. Based on bulid-in P900 module, RLINK has the characteristics of high transmission power, high link rate, high receiving sensitivity, etc. The ground-to-air communication distance is up to 30+KM , the transmitting power can reach 1W , besides the module supports wide voltage input (5\uff5e55V) and high-speed frequency hopping. The module has the operating temperature range of -40 to 80 degrees, with shell of CNC aviation aluminum alloy materials.

The mounting hole is a through hole with a diameter of 3.2, which is suitable for M3 bolt. Figure1.2 Part 2 Use Guide 2.1 Interface The RLINK module has two GH1.25 interfaces, shown in Figure 2 .1, where the left side is the power supply interface, which is recommended to use the provided circuit board for power supply, and the right side is a serial interface. Figure2.1 2.2 Default Parameter RLINK has been configured when you get it. The default link rate is 115 kbps, the boud rate of serial interface is 57600, and the default broadcast mode is Point to Point. If you want to modify the relevant parameters, please refer to Part 3 for custom configurations. 2.3 Communication Pixhawk Flight Controller Please connect the RLINK serial interface to controller\u2019s Telem1 or Telem2 interface. Other Devices Please follow the interface definition to connect the RLINK serial interface to other device serial interface (RX-TX TX-RX GND-GND), if needed. 2.4 Power Suply Since output power up to 1W, some controller\u2019s and computer\u2019s interfaces have not the ability to supply such high power, it is recommended strongly that using a separate battery to supply power for RLINK for the stability. 2.5 Ground Station Connect RLINK(the ground end) to computer as a monitor via a data cable, it can be auto connected when using QGroundControl. While when using Mission Planner as your ground station, it is necessary to select communication port and baud rate as shown in figure 2.2 at first, click CONNECT and then wait for the connection to complete. Figure2.2 Part 3 Configuration RLINK has been configured at the factory and generally does not require additional configuration. If you need to modify the parameters, you can customize the configuration according to the instructions below. 3.1 Enter Configuration Mode Connect RLINK(the ground end) to the computer via a data cable at first, make sure the your serial assistant can communicate with RLINK, press and hold the RLINK CONFIG key with a thimble or other sharp object. The RLINK will enter configuration mode when the serial assistant pops up the NO CARRIER 0K prompt and then release CONFIG key. Figure3.1 After entering configuration mode, the configuration can be completed by sending the relevant parameters via the serial assistant (all with OK after successful configuration). Noting that every configuration command needs to be followed by a carriage return. 3.2 Common Commands Reference Common commands ATS101: Operator Mode\uff080 \u2013 Master\uff1b1 \u2013Repeater\uff1b2 \u2013 Slave\uff09 ATS133: Network Type\uff080 \u2013 Point to Mutlipoint\uff1b1 \u2013 Point to Point\uff09 ATS102: Serial Baud Rate\uff080 - 230400\uff1b1 - 115200\uff1b2 - 57600\uff1b3 - 38400\uff1b4 - 28800\uff1b5 - 19200\uff1b6 - 14400\uff1b7 - 9600\uff1b8 - 7200\uff1b9 - 4800\uff1b10 - 3600\uff1b11 - 2400\uff1b12 - 1200\uff1b13 \u2013 600\uff1b14 - 300\uff09 ATS103: Wireless Link Rate\uff080 - 172800\uff1b1 - 230400\uff1b2 - 276480\uff1b3 - 57600\uff1b4 - 115200\uff09 ATS108: Output Power\uff0820 - 100\uff1b21 - 125\uff1b22 - 160\uff1b23 - 200\uff1b24 - 250\uff1b25 - 320\uff1b26 - 400\uff1b27 - 500\uff1b28 - 630\uff1b29 - 900\uff1b30 -1000\uff09 ATS104: Network Address\uff081 ~ 4294967295\uff09 ATS105: Unit Address (1 ~ 65535) ATS140: Destination Address (1 ~ 65535) Load Factory Default Configuration AT & F10: Master of Point to Point AT & F11: Slave of Point to Point AT & F12: Repeater of Point to Point AT & F7: Master of Point to Multipoint AT & F8: Slave of Point to Multipoint AT & F9: Repeater of Point to Multipoint 3.3 Point to Point Configuration Please copy the reference commands to the serial assistant, press enter and then click Send, and the configuration is successful with OK: Master (ground end) parameter settings\uff1a * Note\uff1a ATS105: 1; ATS140: from 2 to 65535. * Example: Set to Master mode, Baud rate of 115200, Link rate of 230400, Network address 1234567890, Output power 100mW, Unit address 1, Destination address 2.
